## Quick Start

If you want to create your own project lists check the [guide.](custom_project_collections.md)

If you already have a project collection use `sc clone` by itself to see a list of your projects.

Then, use `sc clone project_name` to clone that project or `sc clone project_name directory` to clone it into a specified directory.

## Usage

For a more indepth look at commands check the [usage page.](usage.md)
